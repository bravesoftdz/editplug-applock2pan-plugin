# editplug-applock2pan-plugin
Plugin for EditPlug text editor, Applock extended (2 panels)

Original "Applock" plugin is only one panel to lock other applications inside the editplug text editor for convenient access.

This plugin offers 2 panels to lock 2 different external applications (like a tile window manager) inside EditPlug text editor

DLL plugin compiled with Delphi 5 but should compile in other later Delphi versions too
